My NFT project was part of my block chain engineering course. The challenge involved creating my own Token and putting it into play in a competition that the professor created for the class. 
The competition involved trading our own tokens against the teacher’s token. Prior to this, and outside the scope of the class, I had been fascinated by the material and had spent hours studying 
the teacher’s code. It was an “above and beyond” effort that really paid off. When the contest came I won. There was a prize for the winning token and most effective code. I won both making it 
not only a great win but reinforced in me the importance of following my interests.
